## Crux

- making file and exporting
- adding form 
- adding state to form 

## Making a functional component in another file and exporting

Let's just start with making a new file called form.js ,import React, and make a basic functional component.
<br/>

<div class="code-block">

``` Javascript

import React from "react"

const Form =()=>{
return(<></>);
}

```

</div>

<br/>

I usually use template tag( <></> ) for initializing to avoid unnecessary divs

We can export a component just like anyother function or object in Javascript aka by using export. So let's export the function at the end.

<br/>

<div class="code-block">

``` Javascript 

import React from "react"

const Form =()=>{
return(<></>);
}

export default Form;

```

</div>

<br/>

no lets import it in our index.js assuming the form.js is in same folder we can import with the following code

<br/>

<div class="code-block">

``` Javascript 

/*index.js*/
import Form from "./form";

```

</div>

<br/>

### What is state

The heart of every React component is its ‚Äústate‚Äù, an object that determines how that component renders & behaves. In other words, ‚Äústate‚Äù is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive by re-rendering the component everytime the "state" changes.

### What is useState()

The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components.it's syntax is 

<br/>

<div class="code-block">

``` Javascript 

const [state,setState]=useState(initial)

```

</div>

<br/>

## Making Form and adding state

We'll make a simple login form with 2 input elements, 1 for email and 1 for password.

<br/>

<div class="code-block">

``` Javascript 

const Form =()=>{
  return(<>
<input placeholder="email">
</input>
<input placeholder="password">
</input>
</>);
}

```

</div>

<br/>

Now for adding state in a functional component we would need to import useState from react, so let's import and add a state named email in the component 


<br/>

<div class="code-block">

``` Javascript 

import React,{useState} from "react";

const Form =()=>{
const [email,setemail] = useState("");
return(<>
<input placeholder="email">
</input>
<input placeholder="password">
</input>
</>);
}

export default Form;

```

</div>

<br/>

now we also need to create an onChange function on email so that everytime something is added to the email input box vakue of our state also changes.
**note that we make the type of variable is const as we should not be able to change state from anywhere other than the setemail function** 


<br/>

<div class="code-block">

``` Javascript 

const Form =()=>{
const [email,setemail] = useState("");
return(<>
<input placeholder="email" 
value={email}
onChange={e=>setemail(e.target.value)}>
</input>
<input placeholder="password">
</input>
</>);
}

```

</div>

<br/>

lets repeat the steps for password as well.


<br/>

<div class="code-block">

``` Javascript 

const Form =()=>{
  const [email,setemail] = useState("");
  const [password,setpassword] = useState("");

  return(<>
<input placeholder="email" 
value={email}
onChange={e=>setemail(e.target.value)}>
</input>
<input placeholder="password" 
value={password} 
onChange={e=>setpassword(e.target.value)}>
</input>
</>);
}

```

</div>

<br/>

now we can test the re-rendering by adding the a console.log anywhere inside the component. Lets add the log to show the current value of email and password.

<br/>

<div class="code-block">

``` Javascript 
  return(<>
{console.log({email,password})}
<input placeholder="email" 
value={email}
onChange={e=>setemail(e.target.value)}>
</input>
<input placeholder="password" 
value={password} 
onChange={e=>setpassword(e.target.value)}>
</input>
</>);
}

```

</div>

<br/>

If you've followed correctly till now you've successfully created your first react app üéâüéäüéâ
